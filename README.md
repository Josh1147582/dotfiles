# Josh's Dotfiles

Covers zsh, [neo]vim, i3, and emacs. Mostly emacs.

## Usage
- Clone the repo with the `--recursive` flag.
- Run `stow prog` to install symlinks for prog. For example, `stow emacs` will install symlinks for all emacs dotfiles.

## TODO
- [ ] Find a better way to keep my custom ctags executable.
- [ ] Override
- [ ] Look at smart-mode-line-powerline and see if I can write my own smart-mode-line config
- [ ] Find a better way to display all the eyebrowse space bindings
- [ ] Add "kill window n" eyebrowse keybindings
- [ ] Finish up Shackle rules for windows like help and repl windows. Where they're positioned, whether or not they're focused, etc.
- [ ] Learn/configure auctex
- [ ] Override/work with evil goto-definition, depending on my mode (for example, use `intero-goto-definion` in haskell buffers)

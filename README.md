# Josh's Dotfiles

Covers zsh, [neo]vim, i3, and emacs. Mostly emacs.

## Usage
- Clone the repo with the `--recursive` flag.
- Run `stow prog` to install symlinks for prog. For example, `stow emacs` will install symlinks for all emacs dotfiles.

## TODO
- [ ] Find a better way to keep my custom ctags executable.
